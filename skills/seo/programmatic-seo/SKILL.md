# Programmatic SEO (pSEO)

## 1. Core Concept
Programmatic SEO involves generating landing pages at scale by merging structured data (e.g., from an API, database, or CSV) with highly optimized templates. (e.g., "Best [Service] in [City]").

## 2. Avoiding Thin Content & Doorway Penalties
Google strictly penalizes "doorway pages" that offer no unique value.
*   **Unique Value Injection:** Do not just change the city name. Inject unique data (e.g., weather stats, local reviews, specific regulations).
*   **Content Spintax:** Use advanced LLMs to write completely unique introductions and summaries for each permutation, avoiding duplicate content filters.

## 3. Indexation Control
When generating 100,000 pages, crawl budget becomes critical. Use XML Sitemaps strictly for the highest-value programmatic pages, and rely on robust internal linking (e.g., state > county > city directories) for the rest.


## 🤖 OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW & AI AGENT EXECUTION

### 1. Error Handling & Edge Cases
| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **URL Unreachable (DNS/404/500)** | Report failure clearly. Do not guess page content. Suggest verifying the URL. |
| **Content Behind Paywall / Login** | Analyze visible portion only (meta tags, headers). Note the limitation. |
| **Thin Content (<100 words)** | Flag as potentially JS-rendered or gated. Request full HTML dump if needed. |
| **JavaScript Rendering Blocked** | Fallback to raw HTML analysis and warn user of rendering disparities. |

### 2. Required Data Sources & Tool Integrations
When executing this skill, an AI agent should ideally leverage:
*   **Google Search Console API:** For indexing status, CTR, and query data.
*   **PageSpeed Insights / CrUX API:** For Core Web Vitals field data.
*   **Ahrefs / Moz / DataForSEO:** For backlink index and keyword search volume.
*   **Firecrawl / Jina AI:** For deep-page extraction and semantic parsing.

### 3. E-E-A-T & Quality Scoring Matrix
When auditing content, apply this exact weighting model (based on Google's explicit priority):
*   **Trustworthiness (30/100)**: Contact info, HTTPS, privacy policy, clear sourcing. *(Most Important)*
*   **Expertise (25/100)**: Author bio, technical accuracy, appropriate depth.
*   **Authoritativeness (25/100)**: External citations, brand mentions, recognizable entity.
*   **Experience (20/100)**: Original research, case studies, first-hand media/anecdotes.

### 4. Google's "Who / How / Why" Heuristic
Before deep scoring, apply the fundamental Helpful Content check:
*   **Who?** Is the author clear and visible? (Vital for YMYL).
*   **How?** Was process disclosed? (Original research vs AI regurgitation).
*   **Why?** Is this here to help people, or just to catch search traffic?

### 5. AI Citation Readiness (GEO) & LLM Visibility
Optimize for Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and Perplexity:
*   **Format:** Clear, quotable statements (134-167 word answer blocks).
*   **Structure:** Q&A heading hierarchy.
*   **Attribution:** Strong first-party data and statistics.
*   **Tracking:** Measure LLM citation frequency (not just SERP ranking).
